This release includes a Dask scheduler and {{ .Values.dask.worker.replicas }} Dask workers.

To connect to the Dask cluster, use the following address of the scheduler:
"{{ template "dask.fullname" . }}-scheduler:{{ .Values.dask.scheduler.servicePort }}"

If you want, you can access dask scheduler from a jupyter notebook. Be careful to choose a compatible python version.

The version is {{ .Values.dask.scheduler.image.tag }}

If you want to connect to s3 storage, add the following storage_options:

storage_options={
    "client_kwargs": {
        "endpoint_url": 'https://'+'minio.lab.sspcloud.fr',
    },
}

NOTE: It may take a few minutes before the service is ready to accept connections
